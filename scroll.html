                  <h1>1996</h1>
                    <p>The year is 1996 and a deadly virus has been released and wiping out most of humanity, the survivors forced to live underground. A group known only as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to be responsible for releasing the virus. Flash forward to 2035, James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner beneath the city of Philadelphia and has been chosen to be trained and sent back in time to help develop a cure for the virus. During his lengthy and rigorous training in a post-apocalyptic Philadelphia, James set foot above ground for the first time in decades, witnessing the true terror of the outfall of the 12 monkeys virus.

                  <p2>During his period of training, Cole starts to have recurring nightmares about a shooting and a chase scene in an airport involving him. As he finds himself alone, taking samples and getting acclimated, he encounters a bear that frightens him and induces the same flashback as his dreams. The scientists in charge of his training never communicate with him in person and retain a mask of anonymity, adding to his growing discomfort and slipping grip on his sanity.
